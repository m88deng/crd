              I'm a CFA charterholder with over 15 years of experience analyzing markets and companies across global equity markets. My approach combines fundamental research with a disciplined, long-term investment philosophy.

              This platform exists to share rigorous, independent analysis—free from the noise and short-termism that often dominate financial media. I focus on helping investors develop a clear framework for thinking about risk, valuation, and business quality.
