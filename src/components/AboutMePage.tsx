                <p>
                  I'm a CFA charterholder with over 15 years of experience analyzing markets and companies across global equity markets. My career has spanned institutional asset management, equity research, and portfolio analysis, with a consistent focus on fundamental research and disciplined valuation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my career, I've developed expertise across multiple sectors including financial services, industrials, technology, healthcare, and energy. This breadth of experience informs my approach to sector rotation analysis and cross-sector valuation comparisons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I hold a CFA charter from the CFA Institute and maintain ongoing professional development through research, industry conferences, and continuous study of market history and behavioral finance.

              <div className="space-y-5">
                <p>
                  My approach to markets is grounded in fundamental analysis and long-term thinking. I believe that rigorous research, combined with patience and discipline, provides the foundation for sound investment decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Key principles that guide my analysis:

                    <strong className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Business Quality Matters:</strong> Sustainable competitive advantages, pricing power, and capital allocation discipline are critical determinants of long-term returns.
                  </li>
                  <li className="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
                    <strong className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Valuation Discipline:</strong> Price is what you pay, value is what you get. Understanding the relationship between current prices and intrinsic value is essential.
                  </li>
                  <li className="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
                    <strong className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Risk Management:</strong> Successful investing requires understanding both the probability and magnitude of potential outcomes, not just upside scenarios.
                  </li>

                    <strong className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Independent Thinking:</strong> Markets are driven by consensus views, but exceptional returns often require the conviction to differ from the crowd when evidence supports it.
                  </li>
                  <li className="text-[var(--color-text-secondary)] leading-relaxed">
                    <strong className="text-[var(--color-text-primary)]">Long-Term Perspective:</strong> Short-term market movements are often noise. Focus on fundamental business performance over multi-year periods.
